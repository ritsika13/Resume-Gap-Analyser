# SkillSight

SkillSight is a career insight platform that helps users plan their career growth. Once users indicate which roles they are interested in, it compares the user's resume to the skills required for those roles and recommends jobs, online courses, and other next steps to help them close the gap.

The goal is to provide personalized, data-driven guidance to help users confidently progress toward their career goals.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS


## 📦 Python Version Notes

Python 3.10.13 to ensure compatibility with core libraries and our backend modules.

Later on, if we build LLM-based features (e.g. chatbots, PDF parsing with LlamaIndex), we may use Python 3.11+ in a separate environment or feature branch to support those tools.

This keeps our base system stable while giving us flexibility for future expansion.
